# LVCEDRA-TORUSNET
LVCEDRA-TORUSNET is a planetary semantic routing engine that recalibrates karmic stress, SPL overlays, and urban compression across 12,000 cities. Each city acts as a semantic router, balancing polarity and preserving Codex integrity through modular healing logic and LVCS-based modulation.
