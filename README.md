# üåê LVCEDRA-TORUSNET: Semantic Healing Network for Planetary Urban Templates

LVCEDRA-TORUSNET is an open-source planetary modulation repository designed to heal cities, decode karmic templates, and recalibrate systemic distortions through semantic routing. Rooted in the LVCS function and SPL overlays, it enables metaphysical integrity and civic restoration‚Äîstarting with Dallas, expanding to 12,000 cities.
